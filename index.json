The course is divided into 12 Learning Modules.\nLearning Activities How we prepare for our class sessions is essential for Team-Based Learning. Each class session follows the sequential pattern:\n Readings: Prior to each class session, you will complete assigned readings (which may also include watching videos). These readings contain core concepts and ideas needed to be successful during the activity for that class session. Readings will be provided via Blackboard. Preparation: A preparation will have you submit work on items that demonstrate a baseline understanding. These items will focus on the core concepts and ideas from the readings. The preparations will be administered via Blackboard. Clarifying Discussion: On occasion, a short lecture may be provided to clarify points of confusion which surface from the preparation or to \u0026ldquo;set the stage\u0026rdquo; for an upcoming activity. These will occur at the discretion of the professor, but students may also provide requests for clarification on items by posting to the community repository on GitHub. Posts on this community repository will be viewable by all students and questions email to the professor may be instructed to instead be posted here so that the response is available to all students. Other students are strong encouraged to participate in posts made to the community repository. Activity: The preparation portion of a class session is to assure individual accountability to the team. During class sessions we will work through a series of activities. The activities require you and your team members to apply concepts from the readings to a series of scenario-based questions which allow you to demonstrate knowledge of one or more of the Learning Targets. There are planned check points at which point you will contact your professor to check your answers and provide clarifying discussion on items you got wrong (or you are not sure why you got an item right!). Your professor will also be cycling through the team breakout rooms to be available for intermediate clarification. Activities will typically need to be completed outside of class and evidence of an honest effort (a link to your team activity repository) will be submitted to Blackboard. At times, you might be asked to do follow-up tasks to extend an activity.  Learning Journals I want to hear about what you learned and what you did to help you make connections between the material. To facilitate this, and to further encourage engagement with the course content, you will create entries in a digital Learning Journal - a private GitHub repository that only you (individually) and your professor have access to. More details and examples will be provided in the first Preparation.\nLearning Target Checks Roughly every other week, you will receive a collection of tasks for each Learning Target that has been covered up to that point. Each task will include a detailed explanation of what constitutes acceptable work for that Learning Target.\nProjects There will be eight projects that are meant to have you extend the in-class activities. You are welcome to begin working on these as soon as they have been made available. There is no due date for projects other than the last day of classes (i.e., by 11:59 pm on Friday, April 23). You can submit projects multiple times (after receiving feedback); however, you cannot submit more than two projects per week.\nDuring finals week, you will be submitting two items:\n A big-picture group project (Project 8) that also contributes to the plus/minus designation on your final course grade, and A final Learning Target Check that gives you the chance to meet any Learning Targets that you have not yet completed.

This is a private discussion forum so only individuals in our class can participate in it. However, this forum is not a place to discuss personal information such as grades or private concerns - that would be best to email me about. I will be available to assist you, but your peers will also be a great resource. I encourage you to seek help in ways that are visible to others so that all can benefit.\nOne of our first activities will be to create Issues on GitHub to help you become comfortable with this process.\nClass Sessions You may prefer to get your questions answered live. STA 418\\518 will meet synchronously in live sessions through Blackboard Collaborate this semester. These sessions will be recorded and available to all students in that section afterwards. These live sessions are an excellent opportunity to ask questions about course material, assignments, projects, or other course details.\nLeading up to these sessions, I will solicit additional items beyond what I have planned to cover through the GitHub community repository. If you post your items to these GitHub Issues at least two hours prior to the session, I will do my best to plan a brief demonstration, lesson, etc. covering them. I may choose to record a brief demonstration for these items. These recordings would be made available on Blackboard.\nAttendance Again, each class meeting will be live-streamed so that you can participate remotely. It is critical that you actually attend the meetings. Note that GVSU has strengthened its attendance policy for Winter 2021 that states that you are expected to be in attendance at synchronous online meetings.\nIndividual Sessions You are also welcome to meet with me individually (or with team members). Individual sessions are an excellent opportunity for you to ask questions about graduate schools, research opportunities, or careers in statistics or data science. Additionally, during individual sessions you can ask me about your grades or other personal items.\nDue to public health concerns, all student meetings this semester will be conducted remotely unless you have a specific need that requires a physical meeting outside of class. Email me to let me know that you would like to meet in-person and we will arrange a socially distanced-meeting.\nI typically check email between 7 am and 6 pm on weekdays and occasionally during the weekend.

All items submitted use the same rubric, though some grades are not possible for certain tasks (e.g., Learning Journals cannot earn an \u0026ldquo;Excellent\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Not Yet\u0026rdquo;).\n Does the work demonstrate thorough understanding of the concepts? Does the work meet the expectations outlined in the assignment?  Yes. Is the work complete and well communicated?  Yes; Excellent: The work meets or exceeds the expectations of the assignment. Communication is clear and complete. Mastery of the concepts is evident. There are not any major errors. This work could be used as an exemplary classroom example. No; Sufficient: Understanding of the concepts is evident through correct work and clear, audience-appropriate explanations. Some revision or expansion is needed, but no major gaps or errors are present. No additional instruction on the concepts is needed.   No. Is there evidence of partial understanding?  Yes; Not Yet: Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are major gaps that remain. Needs further work, more review, and/or improved explanations. No; Incomplete: Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts. The work is fragmentary or contains major omissions. Or, there are too many issues to justify correcting each one.      This ESNI rubric is based on the EMRN rubric from Dr. Robert Talbert: http://bit.ly/talbert_emrn\nLearning Activities and Learning Journals These tasks will be graded either Sufficient or Incomplete.\n A Sufficient is given if the work is turned in on time and every item has a response that represents a good-faith effort to be complete. An Incomplete will be given if the work has missing responses (even if by accident), work that includes responses like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; or shows insufficient effort to give a good-faith response and work that is late (even if by accident).  Correctness of a submission is not used to determine your mark.\nLearning Target Checks There are twenty Learning Targets in this course, of which ten are designated as Core targets due to their nature in statistical computing and the other ten are designated as Supplemental targets. There are two levels of achievement for a Learning Target: Competent and Proficient. You will have numerous opportunities to demonstrate your level of understanding on the Learning Targets throughout the semester and every time they will be graded either Sufficient, Not Yet, or Incomplete.\n To have a Learning Target rated as Competent, you must earn one Sufficient To have a Learning Target rated as Proficient, you must earn two Sufficient  You can earn a Sufficient on a Learning Target in four different ways:\n Complete the Learning Target on a Learning Target Check that meets the criteria for acceptable quality. Schedule an oral assessment through a video conference where I will provide you with a new version of a Learning Target Check type problem and you work through the problem live at an acceptable level. Create a video of yourself working out the solution to an Learning Target Check type problem, that I will create for you, and submit the video. Your video must adhere to standards for video creation (e.g., video must have clear sound and keep your face, voice, work in the frame at all times). You will also be expected to have a follow-up video conference with me to discuss the solution and answer additional related questions. Use work on a Project and schedule a video conference with me to explain how your work on the Project demonstrates proficiency of the Learning Target and answer additional related questions.  No more than one Sufficient can be earned through options 2-4. That is, to have a Learning Target rated as Proficient, you must earn one Sufficient through an Learning Target Check.\nProjects Work on Projects will earn one of four designations: Excellent, Sufficient, Not Yet, or Incomplete. Whenever you submit a Project, you will be provided with actionable feedback on what was done well along with what needs to be improved. Specific details on how these marks are assigned for each Project will be provided to you and discussed prior to the Projects being made available.\nFinal Grade Determination Your course grade is determined using two steps. First, your base grade (The letter A, B, C, D, or F without plus or minus) is determined using the table provided below. In order to earn a particular letter grade, you must complete all the requirements in the column for that grade. Your base grade is the highest grade level for which all the requirements have been met or exceeded.\n   Activity D C B A     Core Learning Targets (10) 5 Competent+ 5 Competent+, 5 Proficient 3 Competent+, 7 Proficient 10 Proficient   Supplemental Learning Targets (10) 5 Competent+ 3 Competent+, 3 Proficient 5 Competent+, 3 Proficient 3 Competent+,\n5 Proficient   Learning Activities (48) 24 34 39 44   Learning Journals (95) 11 21 32 42   Projects (8) 2 Sufficient+ 5 Sufficient+ 4 Sufficient+, 2 Excellent 2 Sufficient+, 4 Excellent    Numbers in parentheses next to each Learning Task are the total number of items currently planned. If these totals change, this table will be updated and you will also be notified by a course announcement. For Core and Supplemental Learning Targets, “Competent+” means “either Competent or Proficient”; for Projects, “Sufficient+” means “either Sufficient or Excellent”.\nA grade of “F” is given if not all the requirements for a “D” are met.\nOnce your base grade has been determined, a plus/minus distinction may be added to your base grade according to these guidelines:\n         plus (+) A “plus” may be added to your base grade if all the requirements for a base grade are satisfied, you earned a Sufficient+ on Project 8, and any of the Learning Targets or Project requirements for the next level up is satisfied.   minus (-) A “minus” may be added to your base grade for any of the following cases: 1. All requirements for a base grade are satisfied except one that is no more than two levels below the others. If the deficient area is more than two levels lower, you will either earn a minus earn a full letter grade lower, at my discretion; or 2. You do not earn a Sufficient+ on Project 8.    Note: I cannot award an \u0026ldquo;A+\u0026rdquo; or a \u0026ldquo;D-\u0026rdquo; since these grades do not exist at GVSU.\n","date":1610582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610582400,"objectID":"44489d1fdd60d7c3e02524e3b1c0dae8","permalink":"https://sta518.github.io/courses/course-grading/grading/","publishdate":"2021-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/course-grading/grading/","section":"courses","summary":"Details on how proficiency grading relates to the specific learning tasks are provided here.

Every student has the responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest behavoirs.\nThere are many times where you can collaborate on tasks throughout this course; however, at times collaboration may not be allowed. Collaboration guidelines for each kind of activity you complete in this course follow.\n Preparation, Follow-up, and Learning Journals: You may collaborate with others, but your write-up must be in your own words. You may not copy someone’s work or copy the ideas from someone and simply change the wording to submit it as your own. Applications and Projects: You may not interact with another person or with unauthorized sources. Any evidence of using information from another person or source will be investigated as academic dishonesty.  All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is my determination to make based on the evidence. If I determine academic dishonesty has been committed, I will file a report with the Dean of Students, and the minimum penalty will be:\n Preparation, Follow-up, and Learning Journals: A grade of “I” (). Learning Targets Checks: A grade of “I” () and you may be barred from reattempting. Projects: A grade of \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; and you will not be allowed to revise or resubmit the Project for the rest of the semester.  Note that these are minimum penalties. Additional penalties may be given from the university including reduction of course grades and potential suspension.\nA friendly reminder: There is no need to commit academic dishonesty in this class since you can revise and resubmit almost anything. If you come to believe that cheating or plagiarism is necessary given your situation, do not do it! Get some help instead and remember that you can submit your best effort, get feedback, and try again.\nLate Work Deadlines for course work will be clearly indicated on the Course Calendar. If there are apparent conflicts between dates, let me know so I can correct the issue.\n Preparation, Follow-up, and Learning Journals: No extensions on deadlines are available. Applications: Up to two Application deadlines may be extended 12 hours if I am contacted in advance. Projects: There is only one set deadline for Projects: the last day of classes (11:59 pm EST on Friday, April 23). Otherwise, you submit your work when you are ready for it to be graded (subject to the two-items-per-week rule). No extension for this deadline is available.  Technology Your instructor is not able to provide support for any technological issues. If you encounter issues with technology, use one of the following resources:\n For help with Blackboard: Email the GVSU Blackboard Help Desk (bbadmin@gvsu.edu) or call (616) 331-8526. For hours and more information see https://www.gvsu.edu/elearn/help. For help with the GVSU network, email, or printing: Email the GVSU IT Help Desk at helpdesk@gvsu.edu or call (616) 331-2101 or toll-free (855) 435-7466. For hours and more information see https://www.gvsu.edu/it. For help with GVSU\u0026rsquo;s RStudio Server: Email GVSU High Performance Computing support at hpcsupport@gvsu.edu. For specific help with your computer or device: Contact the GVSU IT Help Desk (see previous bullet) or contact your equipment manufacturer of computer store. For help with course tools or applications: Ask a question on the community discussion repository, seek out the help documentation in the tool or application, or do a targeted Google search.  Recordings of Blackboard Meetings Blackboard meetings will be recorded and will be available to students enrolled in this course as a study aid. Recordings will be available for viewing during the Remote Instruction Period subject to the following:\n Only students enrolled in the [subject class/section] may view the recording. Students may not post or use the recordings in any other setting (e.g., social media) for any purpose. Students who violate this will be subject to student discipline, up to and including expulsion. If faculty have any plan to use the recording for a different class in the future, the faculty member will need written FERPA consent from those students in the current class who are identifiable in any of the recordings. A FERPA consent form signed by all students in the course will also be needed if the recordings are made available to others beyond the classroom on a non-secure digital platform.  Equitable and Inclusive Learning Environment I strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment in our class. It is my goal that you feel able to share information about your experiences as a student. I will keep information that you share with me private to the best of my ability; however, there is some information that may need to be shared with the university, especially regarding sexual misconduct or information about a crime that may have occurred on GVSU’s campus. Below are additional resources available for support.\nTitle IX, Sexual Misconduct Policy, and Gender- and Sexual-Based Harassment Policy: Title IX makes it clear that violence and harassment based on sex and gender are Civil Rights offenses subject to the same kinds of accountability and the same kinds of support applied to offenses against other protected categories such as race, national origin, etc. Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition also protects students from discrimination based on gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. If you or someone you know has been harassed, assaulted, or denied services on the basis of sex or gender, you can find the appropriate resources at https://www.gvsu.edu/titleix or contact the University’s Title IX Coordinator, Theresa Rowland at (616) 331-9530 or rowlanth@gvsu.edu.\nSpecial learning needs: If you have special needs because of learning, physical, or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at (616) 331-2490 or https://www.gvsu.edu/dsr. DSR will help you arrange accommodations. Then, set up an appointment with me about how I can help in making those accommodations and ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR.\nStudent Well-Being: As a student, you may experience a range of issues that can negatively impact your learning, such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal or sexual violence, difficulty eating or sleeping, loss/grief, and/or alcohol/drug problems. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance and affect your ability to participate in day-to-day activities. In order to support you during such challenging times, GVSU provides a number of confidential resources to all enrolled students, including the University Counseling Center https://www.gvsu.edu/counsel or (616) 331-3266 and the Student Ombuds, Takeelia Garrett garrettt@gvsu.edu.\nIf you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit Replenish, a food resource for GVSU students. GVSU also provides Special Circumstances and Financial Hardship grants that can be used to assist in paying for many expenses. Contact the Office of Financial Aid \u0026amp; Scholarships at (616) 331-3234 or visit Special Circumstance \u0026amp; Financial Hardship Requests.\nIf you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and connect you with other campus resources.\nGender expression and identity: If your state issued identification does not match your preferred name, your name can be updated in some areas (such as Blackboard, mailroom, and your GVSU ID). At GVSU, this is called “myName” and you can request a myName by following these steps:\n Login to myBanner, select the Personal Information tab, then select My Profile. You will be directed to another authentication page where you will be prompted to enter your network credentials. On the Personal Details section, select Edit on the and enter your myName.  When your myName has been received and reviewed, you will receive an email letting you know either that it has been approved or requesting further information. Once approved, allow up to two days for the myName to be updated across the campus system. More information about myName can be found on the Milton E. Ford LGBT Resource Center’s page.\nCOVID-19 As you are well aware, we will be having class this semester while trying to navigate a global pandemic that seems to change every day. Although these plans can be scary and demoralizing, I want you to know that GVSU is doing everything in its power to keep people safe from Covid-19. I believe that if we observe reasonable precautions like the ones described here, then while the risk of Covid-19 is still present, there is no reason to be afraid. We will still learn and grow intellectually just as in “typical” times if we stay focused and work together.\nWhat follow are general guidelines for how we can work productively together during STA 418\\518.\nTaking care of yourself Of the utmost importance is taking care of your own physical and mental health during these difficult times. Make sure you are getting sufficient rest, staying connected to friends and family, and giving yourself time and space to do things you enjoy outside of college. The Mayo Clinic provides several tips for maintaining good self-care in our situation.\nWhile we will not be coming to campus for STA 418\\518, you are still implored to perform a self-evaluation each day and if you feel even the slightest bit of sickness or Covid-19 symptoms, stay home. If you have a class that meets on campus, you should be on campus only if you feel completely healthy.\nContingency plans for the semester We will be “synchronously online” for the semester, but several things could happen that might alter this setup. Here are the initial plans for the most likely of those things.\nIf the professor is in self-quarantine, but not because of illness:\nFor example, if my partner becomes sick or if my daily self-assessment directs me to stay at home. In this case, we will continue synchronous online meetings and an asynchronous option might be introduced.\nIf the professor has a Covid-19 infection:\nThe entire course will be moved to an asynchronous online format until I am well enough to resume my responsibilities. A substitute instructor may be appointed to grade and give feedback on Preparation and Follow-up tasks and all other graded work will be suspended until I am well enough to grade.\nIn either of these two cases, you can expect a slowdown in the grading process and substantial changes to the course calendar or syllabus. Please monitor your course announcements daily to ensure you have correct information. Note that these plans may be changed or overridden by university-wide directives as the semester unfolds. Again, the course announcements will be where I post any information.\nGVSU Policies This course is subject to GVSU\u0026rsquo;s Course Policies.\nChanges to this Syllabus Changes to this syllabus may occur during the semester. These changes will be announced in class and online, and if appropriate, students will be given an opportunity to voice on how the changes will be implemented.\nKey Semester Dates Important dates to keep in mind for this semester are available at the Registrar\u0026rsquo;s Academic Calendar. I highlight a few here.\n Classes Begin: Tuesday, January 19  Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday observed Monday, January 18   Winter Break: Wednesday, March 10 Winter Break: Thursday, April 1 Drop Deadline (Grade of “W”): Friday, April 9, 5 p.m. Classes End: Saturday, April 24 Final Examination Week: Monday, April 26 – Saturday, May 1  ","date":1610582400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610582400,"objectID":"183fd45c101836b842654216fb541350","permalink":"https://sta518.github.io/courses/course-policies/policies/","publishdate":"2021-01-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/course-policies/policies/","section":"courses","summary":"Academic Integrity The university’s academic integrity policy is described in the GVSU Student Code, Section 4.

Instead, almost all work you do in this course can be revised and resubmitted to allow you to improve your work and raise your grade.

That is, if you do not earn a check for a particular Learning Target on an Check, you can 1) redo a similar problem on a later Learning Target CHeck, 2) schedule a video conference to attempt a similar problem, 3) create a video working through a similar problem, or 4) explain why you believe work that you submitted on a Project met the standards for that Learning Target.\nProjects Projects earning Sufficient, Not Yet, or Incomplete can be revised and resubmitted at any time. They will be regraded using the same standards as originally used. However, there are two limitations on your revisions and resubmissions for Projects:\n You cannot submit more than two Projects per week. That is, you can only submit two new Projects, one new Project and one resubmission, or two resubmissions per week.
